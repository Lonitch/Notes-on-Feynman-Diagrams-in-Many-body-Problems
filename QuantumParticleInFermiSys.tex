\section{Quantum Particle in Fermi System}
\subsection{Propagator method in many-body systems}
In this chapter we will start with non-interacting Fermi-system problem. This is really a fake many-body problem,since as the problem is actually only a one-body problem. By doing this trivial problem, we will describe Fermi system very simply in terms of a few particles above the Fermi level, and a few removed particles, or "holes" below. Second, it allows us to introduce the language of the many-body problem,"\bluep{occupation number formalism}", or "\bluep{second quantization}". Finally, it shows us how to extend the definition of the propagator to the case where $t_2<t_1$. In this case, \textbf{the Green's function turns out to describe the propagation of removed particles, or "holes", which are represented diagrammatically by a downward-going arrow.}

we again can represent the propagator for this case as an infinite series of diagrams, which may be evaluated approximately by partial summation.

\bluep{The Hartree and Hartree-Fock are the crudest of the approximations and yield quasi particles with infinite lifetimes. The RPA yields the energy and lifetime of quasi particles in a high-density electron gas, while the ladder approxiamation is good for low-density systems like nuclear matter. Only the Hartree and Hartree-Fock will be discussed in this chapter.}

\subsection{Non-interacting Fermi system in external potential: particle- hole picture}
We first introduce the particle-hole nomenclature for describing Fermi systems. Suppose we have a single particle in a potential $U(\mathbf{r})$, with energy eigenstates $\phi_k(\mathbf{r})$. The energy levels may be represented as in Fig.\ref{fig:non-interacting-fermi},where for simplicity the system is non-degenerate.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{screenshots/particle-hole.PNG}
    \caption{Non-interacting Fermi System}
    \label{fig:non-interacting-fermi}
\end{figure}
In the case where $U(\mathbf{r})=0$, the particles are free and $\mathbf{k}$ in \ref{fig:non-interacting-fermi}(a) are momentum, or wavenumber. The ground state of the single particle has energy $\epsilon_F$. If we now put N particles into the system, by Pauli principle the energy levels will be filled from the bottom as shown in \ref{fig:non-interacting-fermi}(a) for $N=5$. The highest filled energy level is the \textit{\textbf{Fermi level}},$\epsilon_F$. In ground state, the free particles fill a sphere in $\mathbf{k}-$space having radius $k_F=\sqrt{2m\epsilon_F}$,where $k_F$ is called the \textbf{Fermi momentum}. The filled sphere is called Fermi sea. The surface of this sphere is \textbf{Fermi surface}.

In Fig \ref{fig:non-interacting-fermi}(b) the excited states of the system are formed by removing a particle from a state below $\epsilon_F$ to a state above. The empty state here is called "hole". In "\bluep{particle-hole description}" we can omit the filled Fermi sea and only focus on excited particle and holes, yielding \ref{fig:non-interacting-fermi}(c) and (d). \textbf{\redp{Since a hole in state $\phi_k$ is actually removal of a particle from the system, the hole represents energy $\epsilon_k$ removed. Hence the hole energy is}}
\begin{equation}\epsilon_{k}^{\text {hole }}=-\epsilon_{k}\end{equation}
The time-dependent wave function is thus
\begin{equation}\psi_{k}(t)^{\text {hole }}=\phi_{k} e^{-i\left(-\epsilon_{k}\right) t}, \quad \epsilon_{k}<\epsilon_{F}\end{equation}
\subsection{A primer of second quantization formalism}
The total wave function for the ground and excited states of a system of non-interacting particles is the Slater determinant:
\begin{equation}\Phi_{k_{1}, \ldots, k_{N}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_{N}\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(N !)}}\left|\begin{array}{cc}
\phi_{k_{1}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{1}\right) \ldots \phi_{k_{1}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{N}\right) \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
\phi_{k_{N}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{1}\right) \ldots \phi_{k_{N}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{N}\right)
\end{array}\right|
\label{slater-determinant}
\end{equation}
\textbf{If the particles are allowed to interact with each other or external potential,} then the exact wave function of the system is a linear combination of \ref{slater-determinant}:
\begin{equation}\Psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_{N}\right)=\sum_{k_{1}, \ldots, k_{N}} A_{k_{1}, \ldots, k_{N}} \Phi_{k_{1}, \ldots, k_{N}}\left(\mathbf{r}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_{N}\right)\end{equation}
That is, the $\Phi_{k_1,k_2,\ldots}$ for the non-interacting system are the basis states used to describe the interacting system. Noting that all particles are indistinguishable, the essential information in \ref{slater-determinant} is just how many particles in each state, $n$. For short, we shall represent this as
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_{k_1,k_2,\ldots}=\left|n_{p_1},n_{p_2},\ldots\right\rangle
\end{equation}
meaning:$n_{p_{1}}$ particles in state $\phi_{p_{1}}, n_{p_{2}}$ in $\phi_{p_{3}},$ etc., where $n=0$ or 1 by Pauli principle. This notation is called "\redp{occupation number notation}". It is important to note that just as the original Slater determinant form a complete orthogonal set of basis functions, so do the states in occupation number notation and we have
\begin{equation}\left\langle n_{1}^{\prime}, \ldots n_{i}^{\prime} \ldots | n_{1}, \ldots, n_{i} \ldots\right\rangle=\delta_{n_1^{\prime}n_1}\ldots\delta_{n_i^{\prime}n_i}\ldots
\end{equation}
The wave function for interacting system is now becoming:
\begin{equation}\Psi=\sum_{n_{1}, \ldots, n_{i}, \ldots} A_{n_{1}, \ldots, n_{i}, \ldots}\left|n_{1}, \ldots, n_{i}, \ldots\right\rangle\end{equation}
In the particle-hole notation, it is necessary to introduce hole creation and destruction operators, $b_1^{\dagger}, b_{1}$, and similarly particle operators $a_1^{\dagger}, a_{1},$ as follows:
if $k_{i}<k_{F},$ then $c_{i}$ destroys a particle under the Fermi level, thus creating a hole. Hence
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\text { for } k_{l}>k_{F}, & c_{l}=a_{l} \\
k_{l}<k_{F}, & c_{l}=b^{\dagger}_l
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\text { for } k_{l}>k_{F}, & c_{l}^{\dagger}=a_{l}^{\dagger} \\
k_{l}<k_{F}, & c_{l}^{\dagger}=b_{l}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Simple examples of how the particle-hole operators work are:
$$a_{i}^{\dagger}|0\rangle=\left|1_i^{p}\right\rangle, \quad a_{i}\left|1_l^{p}\right\rangle=\delta_{il}|0\rangle, \quad b_{j}^{\dagger} a_{i}^{\dagger}\left|1_{m}^{\rho}\right\rangle=\left|1_{m}^{p}, 1_i^{p}, 1_j^{h}\right\rangle$$
where the superscripts represent "particle" and "hole", respectively.
